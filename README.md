# CPSC319-Assignments

Three assignments that have a student implementing specialized variants of some of the data structures presented in the lectures with appropriate associated algorithms to solve the presented problem.

All assignments have in common that they have to produce a program that, after compilation of the source code written and submitted by the student, can be called with two command line arguments for the file the input has to be taken from and the file the system output is written to. So, if your system is called mysystem, the input file is myinput and the file for the output is myoutput, the command for running your system should be:

mysystem myinput myoutput
