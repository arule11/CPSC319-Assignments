## By: Athena McNeil-Roberts    30042085    athena.mcneilrobe1@ucalgary.ca

## Description

The task your system has to perform is to implement a ternary tree with non-empty strings as payload and a set of operations on the tree so that the system can read in a sequence of these operations from the input file and outputs the results from those operations that produce certain outputs (in addition to often manipulating the tree).

## Installation and Running

  1. In the console, direct to the folder containing source files using cd <filepath>
  2. To compile, use command --> javac *.java
